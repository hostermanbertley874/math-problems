# This is an example of generating a random TS code for educational purposes.
# The actual implementation would involve using machine learning algorithms and potentially large datasets.
# Here's how you can generate a simple TS code (Time Series Data) in Python:

import numpy as np

def ts_code():
    # Simple time series with one data point
    t = np.array([1, 2])
    y = [t[0] + t[1]]
    return "TS: " + str(y)

print(ts_code())
